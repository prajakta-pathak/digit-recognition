*The original data.txt consists of 1537 bitmaps and their corrosponding integer is written below them.
*Here we are considering 1500 points as our training data and thus new-wxyz.txt corresponds to wxyz th data point.
*convertintoint.c prints the value corresponding to the name of file entered.
*initialy distance of the bitmap under cosideration from the average bitmap of 0's,1's,... 9's is calculated.
*The least distance from all those distances is calculated and the corrosponding integer is assigned to that bitmap.
*The main program calculates the accuracy of the above algorithm by taking into account 1500 bitmaps
